# SQL Debugger

This project serves as the final project submission for 6.5830 Database Systems for FA2023 (MIT). The team members are Brent Liu, Philip Li, and Chanwoo Yoon.

This project explores ways to create a tool to help debug potentially wrong SQL queries. Our main approach is to use a large language model (OpenAI-based) to understand what the user wants to extract from the database and propose various fixes. While syntax errors do arise in day-to-day uses, we do not focus on them since these problems mostly fall under the realm of LSPs/syntax/parsing (although LLMs do catch these errors).


## TODO: Add instructions on running these models/scripts (to be done tonight 12/12)
